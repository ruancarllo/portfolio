# About

This is the source code for my portfolio, which was written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) with [Preact's TSX](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/typescript) support, importing designs made in [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com).

# Execution

To carry out the processes of serving and building the website, the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) tool is used, managed in the [worker.ts](./worker.ts) file by [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com).

So, to serve the website on the local network, use the command:

```
npm run serve
```

To build and package the website in the [docs](./docs) folder, use:

```
npm run build
```
